        <p>My name is Stephen, and I founded Slic3D Research. I have spent my life to the pursuit of progress and founded Slic3D 
          Research in order to share my results with those who might take the technology further toward the future.
          <p>My research in electromagnetic properties of 3D printed objects gave me the opportunity to expand across two distinct 
            disciplines in engineering: aerospace and electromagnetics. As it turns out, further advancements could be realized
            by manipulating the distinct advantages garnered from additive processes in terms of electromagnetic performance.</p> 
          <p>Throughout my career, I have continuously pursued innovation and don't intend on stopping any time soon. 
            The advancements I've made in additive manufacturing are a piece of the puzzle I'm trying to solve.</p>
        <p>I want 3D printing to finally achieve the types of results that have been promised for years. From hobbyists toys, to
          medical prosthetics, to military applications, additive manufacturing has the capability modernize and grow
          in each of these industries.</p>

        <p>Thank you for joining me on this adventure.</p>
